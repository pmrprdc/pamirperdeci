    <section id="about">
        <p>Meet Pamir Perdeci, the entrepreneurial maverick who didn’t just drop out of college—he dropped some hot beats on soundcloud while exploring his passion for entreprenourship. Starting with Santa Barbara Aerial Media, Pamir took drone video production to new heights, making the skies his playground attending his 3rd college which he also didn't care to finish as an honor student.</p>

<p>Pamir’s entrepreneurial continued as he seeked to fund a lifestyle of fun and freedom. He penned and sold Kindle e-books, turning his words into cash faster than you can say 'prime.'A social media marketing company in Santa Barbara quickly caught wind of his talent, enlisting him to film venture capital courses and Facebook ads that convert e-courses like christian missionaries.</p>

<p>In 2020, Pamir tackled public-school remote IT projects with the precision of a tech wizard,attending to burning computers and broken screens from middle schoolers. When Pamir was working jobs, it was to fund some kind of side hustle but none of the businesses really felt fulfilling but that didn't stop him from exploring new industries, businesses and skills.  When he wasn't mastering drop shipping and using Facebook pixels to sell golf grabbers like hotcakes, he was knocking doors in roofing and solar industries, proving his versatility and business savvy.</p>

<p>In 2022 Pamir took his talents to ineed.com, he had picked up html/css and javascript from an ecommerce bootcamp and started freelancing as a web developer. Here, he learned the coding ropes and built a reputation as a tech whiz in 2023 scoring well over 700 points in generalCoding assessments where he proved his problem solving skills to be robust. His hunger for knowledge led him to BloomTech, where he mastered app development and opened the doors to the world of SaaS projects.</
